# Remote Sensing Analysis
This repository contains my calculation and processing of Clean Marine Aerosol Optical Depth (CMOD), chlorophyll-a concentration (chl-a), wind speed, & Ice as surface 532nm integrated depolarization ratio. 

These variables and techniques take advantage of a wide suite of data available from remote sensing instruments including NASA CALIPSO, MODIS Aqua, and the AMSR-E Sensor.
